# KivousBot
Conversational ChatBot deployed at heroku.
you can talk with Kivous the Bot at https://t.me/kivousbot.
it is connected to heroku PostgreSQL Database for data collection. Messages from the chat will be collected and I will update my model accordingly

I previously trained many basic ML, Dl model, some were guided projects and some were of my own, but in many of them the data were already been prepared and some others datasets were out of my knowlenge of understanding however with this project I have decided to collect my data and train them on my own. So that I can say that this project is mine from head to toe. I don't know which type of data will come also no one can blame me of copying someone's code. it gives me a great pleasure to feel that. Also in real life i would have these types of data only where data will be not cleaned, rubbish, not structured and I think this project shows real life problems better than those previous datasets where someone already prepared them.
